# HotelFixIt

HotelFixIt is a fullstack application that streamlines task management for hotels. The app allows managers and administrators to gather tasks in one central location and delegate them to specific departments. Staff members can log into their account to view their assigned tasks and mark them as completed. The manager can also see which tasks have been completed in real-time, providing oversight and improving efficiency. This app allows hotels to improve communication, organization, and productivity, resulting in a better experience for both staff and guests.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, Express, Tailwind


App is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies. On the frontend, the app is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Tailwind CSS framework for styling. This combination of technologies allows for a responsive, user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.

On the backend, the app is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework. Express.js is used to handle routing and handle HTTP requests and responses. Node.js allows for fast and efficient server-side processing, following MVC architecture and mongoDB for database.



## Lessons Learned:

While building this app I understood and learned the importance of proper data modeling, organizing data in a logical and efficient manner is crucial.
